hey 🐌✨
this is krn and you're witnessing my first venture into tech.</summary> 
  
    my aim is to build a personal site for my radio show and writing pursuits, using html/css to start.
    I'm excited to keep learning how things work together and hope to have more to share in the near future.
    Some ideas:
    -media player skin
    -complex moving art files (ant farm or amoeba)
    -digital collages w linked img vid txt art references
    -links to orgs + happenings in my hometown
