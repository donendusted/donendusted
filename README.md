this is krn and you're witnessing my first venture into tech. 

my aim is to build a personal site for my radio show and writing pursuits, using html/css to launch. I have a lot of ideas I'd like to integrate like a media player skin, some complex moving art files (think ant farm or amoeba), digital collages that include linked img/vid/txt/art references, as well as a collection of interesting outside links for events + happenings in my hometown. I'm excited to keep learning how things work together and hope to share a lot more in the near future.
